# YaST - The Partitioner Module #

The development of the new YaST Partitioner based on storage-ng is not longer
taking place in this repository. All the source code has been merged into the
[yast-storage-ng repository](https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng).

Use this repository only if you need to take a look to the git history of the
initial prototype (before the mentioned merge of both repositories).
